# leet_n_skeet
A mix of problems encountered on Leetcode, Cracking the Coding Interview, or just fun stuff I wanted to tackle.
I use mainly python and occasionally C or C++.  Most the time before I hop immediatly to python I think 
'hmm, can I do this in C'   I Like solving in C and C++ because it serves as good a reference for the languages because I tend to forget the syntax.  I also forget python syntax a lot as well.  Perhaps someday I'll stop writing code with the languages reference doc open next to me but that day seems far away.

This repo serves mostly as a way for me to keep track of how often I work on such problems (not too often)
